today is a new day as everyone says but no one reallly knows what that means

When is the last time you actually planned out what youre going to do and completed it?

This is a lot harder for someone like me, who has a million things on my mind at once.
I have no idea how i have manged but its progress.
One key thing i use is motivation or dedication both go well together.
